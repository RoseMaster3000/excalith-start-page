## RoseMaster's Fork

This is a fork of [Excalith Start Page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page). The follign changes have been made:
* Config Preferecnes (DuckDuckGo, animated SVG background, etc)
* Flexible Search (substring search for more matching)
* Removed link text-labels (I now use name field as a place to list "tags" which works better with my Flexible Search feature)
* Changed lists to render as a grid of large icons
* Removed setting.json caching (I like to edit the settings.json by remoting into my server directly, I prefer my text editor over the build in `config edit` tool)
