## RoseMaster's Fork

This is a fork of [Excalith Start Page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page). The following changes have been made:
* Config Preferences (DuckDuckGo, animated SVG background, etc)
* Flexible Search (sub-string search for more matching)
* Removed Link Text-Labels (I now use name field as a place to list "tags" which works better with my Flexible Search feature)
* Changed Lists (renders as a grid of large icons)
* Removed `setting.json` Caching (I like to edit the `settings.json` by remoting into my server directly, I prefer my text editor over the build in `config edit` tool)
